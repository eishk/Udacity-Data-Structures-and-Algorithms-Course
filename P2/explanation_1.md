In this problem, I used no new data structures, as I rather used binary search in
order to find the square root in time complexity O(logn) time. The reason I used
binary search is due to the fact I needed the time complexity to be logn, which
is only possible thru binary. Because I didn't use any new data structures, the
problem's space complexity is O(1).
