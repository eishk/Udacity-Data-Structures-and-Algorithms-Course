For this problem, the main decision I had to make was in terms of what data structure
I would use to hold the files, and I picked a list because the question outlined
the usage of a list. The biggest difficulty in this problem was the recursive aspect,
and I solved it by thinking logically through how the process would work and what would cause
the program to fail. As for the complexity of this problem, the complexity is
O(n), as it takes O(n) time to find a file with a given extension, and that is
multiplied by number of files. This multiplier does not change complexity, thus
the time is O(n).
